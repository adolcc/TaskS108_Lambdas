**Java Lambda & Stream API Exercises**
This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of exercises designed to illustrate the power and versatility of Lambda Expressions and the Stream API in Java 8 and beyond. Through a series of progressively challenging tasks, you'll explore how these modern Java features enable more concise, readable, and efficient code for data processing and functional programming paradigms.

The exercises are carefully structured across multiple levels, starting with fundamental concepts and gradually introducing more intricate scenarios. This allows for a steady learning curve, enabling you to build a solid understanding of:

Core Lambda Syntax and Usage: Grasping the basics of anonymous functions and their application in various contexts.

Leveraging Functional Interfaces: Understanding how Lambdas seamlessly integrate with pre-defined and custom functional interfaces.

Mastering the Stream API: Discovering how to chain operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing to process collections effectively.

Real-world Scenarios: Applying Lambdas and Streams to common programming challenges, from simple list manipulations to more complex object-oriented data transformations.

Whether you're new to Lambdas and Streams or looking to deepen your understanding, these exercises provide practical examples to solidify your knowledge and enhance your Java programming skills.
